# üö¶ Street Crossing Traffic Signal Simulation

A Raspberry Pi assembly language project simulating a pedestrian crosswalk system, built entirely in ARM assembly.

## üìñ Overview

This project demonstrates how to control GPIO pins directly in ARM assembly to simulate a crosswalk traffic signal with a button trigger.

Using the WiringPi library, the program lights up 5 LEDs (traffic and walk/don‚Äôt walk) in a timed sequence and responds to user input.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Button-triggered sequence**: starts when the pushbutton is pressed
- **Three-stage simulation**:
  1. Walk signal active
  2. Blinking ‚Äúhurry up‚Äù signal
  3. Don‚Äôt Walk / Traffic resumes
- **Direct hardware control** using ARM assembly (`wiringPiSetup`, `digitalWrite`, `digitalRead`)
- **Console messages** showing sequence progression
- **Educational focus** on low-level programming concepts

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Build and Run

1. **Install WiringPi** (on Raspbian):

       sudo apt-get install wiringpi

2. **Assemble the code:**

       g++ streetxing.s -lwiringPi -g -o streetxing

3. **Run the program:**

       sudo ./streetxing

**Note:** `sudo` is required for GPIO access.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- This project is for **educational demonstration only**.
- Full source code is included for reference‚Äî**please do not plagiarize** in academic settings.
- Hardware wiring must match the pin definitions in the code (`LED_TRAF_RED`, etc.).
- Timing delays and blink counts can be adjusted by modifying constants in `streetxing.s`.
